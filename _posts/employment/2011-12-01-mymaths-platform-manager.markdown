Responsible for the MyMaths web service, the then *largest online educational maths platform* in the UK. This role developed from integration of what was a newly acquired business, hooking in back-office systems (SAP, CRM etc), *recruiting*, *training* and *managing a new team* of developers and project managers on to designing and implementing a *complete rewrite* of the system. At it's peak I managed a team of 4 full time programmers, as well a project manager whilst managing the development and day-to-day running of such a well established platform. MyMaths had around *5 million users*, served over *9 million page views* per week and was regularly in the **top 500 Alexa charts**(UK) whilst under my care.
