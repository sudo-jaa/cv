My first 'serious' development role. Working on many projects, learning ActionScript and PHP as well as running MySQL clusters. One highlight of this role was designing and implementing a 'digital book' product. This software eventually went on to be used in over 60 products, as well as winning an IDA Award for a product that was produced for the Indian market.
